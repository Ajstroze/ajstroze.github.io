<![CDATA[ <p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo&mdash;Brave&rsquo;s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser&mdash;on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage. </p> <p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better&mdash;and the answers more accurate and timely&mdash;with the addition of new integrations and <a href="/blog/leo-mixtral/">new models like Mixtral</a>.</p> <p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p> <h2 id="what-can-leo-do">What can Leo do?</h2> <p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you&rsquo;re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p> <ul> <li>Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos</li> <li>Answer questions about content</li> <li>Generate new long form written content</li> <li>Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them</li> <li>Create transcriptions of video or audio content</li> <li>Write code</li> </ul> <p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight&rsquo;s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p> <p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there&rsquo;s no login or signup required&mdash;you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p> <p class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-5"> <picture class=" max-w-maxcontent"> <source srcset="/static-assets/images/optimized/blog/leo-android/images/1.webp" type="image/webp" /> <img src="/static-assets/images/optimized/blog/leo-android/images/1.jpg" alt="Asking Leo for luggage suggestions." class="w-full"/> </picture> <picture class=" max-w-maxcontent"> <source srcset="/static-assets/images/optimized/blog/leo-android/images/2.webp" type="image/webp" /> <img src="/static-assets/images/optimized/blog/leo-android/images/2.jpg" alt="Asking Leo to translate from Spanish to English.

Mixtral&mdash;the default LLM&mdash;can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p> <p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p> <p>For all these reasons, <a href="/blog/leo-mixtral/">we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we&rsquo;ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p> <h2 id="leo-premium">Leo Premium </h2> <p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who&rsquo;d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Users log into their Brave account from their other devices with that subscription.</p> <table class="text-xs"> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align:left"><strong>Feature</strong></th> <th><strong>Leo core</strong></th> <th><strong>Leo Premium</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align:left">Models</td> <td>Mixtral 8x7B (strict rate limits)<br/>Claude Instant (strict rate limits)<br/>Llama 2 13B (higher rate limits)</td> <td>Mixtral 8x7B<br/>Claude Instant<br/>Llama 2 13B</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left">Rate limits</td> <td>Various rate limits</td> <td>Higher rate limits</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left">Quality of conversations</td> <td>Very high, dependent on model</td> <td>Very high</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left">Privacy</td> <td>Inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy and are not retained or used for training</td> <td>Inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy and are not retained or used for training</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align:left">Subscription</td> <td>Free</td> <td>$14.99 monthly</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="smart-ai-still-private-by-default">Smart AI, still private by default</h2> <p>As with all of Brave&rsquo;s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn&rsquo;t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Reverse proxy</strong>: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Responses discarded</strong>: Conversations are not persisted on Brave&rsquo;s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they&rsquo;re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a href="/glossary/ip-address/">IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>No login or account required for access for the free version</strong>: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however). </p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Unlinkable subscription</strong>: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you&rsquo;re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="whats-next-for-leo-and-how-to-get-started">What&rsquo;s next for Leo, and how to get started</h2> <p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who&rsquo;ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they&rsquo;re not seeing it today. Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It&rsquo;s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click <span class="icon bg-icons-active align-sub [--icon-url:url(/leo-icons/product-brave-leo.svg)]" title="Ask Leo icon"></span> &ldquo;Ask Leo&rdquo;. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap &ldquo;<strong>⋮</strong>&rdquo; and then tap <strong>Leo</strong> to get started.</p> <p>To learn more about Brave Leo, check out our main product <a href="/leo/">main product page</a>, or see Leo&rsquo;s product <a href="/blog/leo-roadmap/">roadmap</a>.</p> ]]>
