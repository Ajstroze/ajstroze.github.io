                <h2>What I do</h2>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Earlham College in 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my time there I worked for our CS department as a system administrator, where I gained my first direct experience with formal security and administration practices. That experience led
                    me to pursue a masters in Information security from Carnegie Mellon, where I met a lot of great people, both peers and professors who had already made significant impact in the field. During my masters program I interned with LexisNexis on their Security Operations team. Upon graduating
                    in 2024 I joined LexisNexis full time where I have the opportunity to lead projects that have a direct impact on the security posture of the organization and expanded my knowledge base.

                </p> I am an energetic, curious and driven learner who is passionate about learning the ins and outs of technology and security. I thrive in environments that challenge me and love collaborating with others.
                <p>
